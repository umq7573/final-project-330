In Morgue, the brutal murder of two women is presented as the consequence of an intrusion of a savage outsider into the bounds of civilized society. The first detail encountered by the reader to describe the murders is that they are 'extraordinary' (Poe 10). The corpse of one of the women is noted as 'fearfully mutilated', torn apart with such brutality as to render it unable to 'retain any semblance of humanity' (Poe 11). Upon investigation, it becomes immediately clear that this murder could not have been perpetrated, at least not single handedly, by someone belonging to French society. All witnesses to the murder identify the voice of a foreigner at the crime scene, though they differ on the specific language they hear (Poe 15).  Dupin’s investigation confirms this earlier hunch in the most extreme sense—on the basis of the strength required for such brutality, as well as hairs found at the crime scene, he concludes that this must be the work of none other than an 'Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands' (Poe 28). Dupin thus exonerates not just any single individual, but human society as a whole from being culpable for this crime. This was not the work of rational thought, motivated by some kind of material gain, but rather the extreme reaction of a cornered animal that had no particular reason to be in the country. Even the human who inadvertently enabled this brutal crime by bringing over the animal is immediately declared by Dupin to be 'innocent'  (Poe 31). To the extent that he is 'implicated' due to his negligence (Poe 31), it is in his own capacity as a foreigner, albeit one that does belong in a typical society, as he is a sailor from Malta. Thus, Morgue can be read as an argument that only foreign intrusions, particularly unnecessary intrusions, could possibly be responsible for such a horrifying upsets of the natural order of society. </p><p>The Sign of Four acts as a rejection of Rue Morgue’s explanation for crime by undermining its epistemic assumptions and rejecting its view of the relationship between the foreign and crime. The nature of the detection process followed by Holmes is less precise and more potentially fallible than the process followed by Dupin, a distinction with important epistemic implications. For Dupin, every clue he encounters has a clear cause that is relevant to the subject of inquiry, and by following these clues he invariably will reach the correct result. Not once do we see Dupin revise his expectations or conclude that his initial interpretation of a clue was wrong in light of new evidence. In the world that Dupin inhabits, there is no epistemic uncertainty that criminals could be leveraging to evade detection by society. By contrast, Holmes’ investigative path is more complex and realistic. Though Holmes is largely accurate in his process of deduction, Doyle makes it clear to us that this is a world where it was nonetheless possible for Holmes to have been wrong and to even fail. Before the primary mystery even commences, Holmes himself admits this possibility when he makes a number of accurate guesses as to the nature of a watch shown to him by Watson, explaining that his success was to an extent a product of 'good luck'. Though Holmes does have an uncanny instinct for reading the implications of clues, the epistemic structure of his world is such that he cannot always 'expect to be accurate', and instead must speak only of what the 'balance of probability' holds (Doyle 17). The reader sees this unfold again at the end of 'the Episode of the Barrel', as Toby the bloodhound quite literally leads Holmes and Watson astray (Doyle 137). Finally, when the mystery is at its conclusion, Holmes and Watson almost reach a tragic end as a poison dart misses them by inches (Doyle 206), demonstrating that mere accidents like the aim of a criminal can be the difference between a crime that society is capable of addressing and one that manages to succeed in its usurpation of the normal. Doyle thus suggests that even a society full of Holmeses might still be vulnerable to criminals who operate in this margin of uncertainty. Therefore no single explanation such as foreign influence could ever be completely accountable for social disorder. </p><p>Aside from ruling out the possibility of a single decisive explanation for crime, Doyle’s story also specifically indicts the foreign as a useful explanation of crime. Like the murder in Morgue, the murder in The Sign of Four is initially marked by the foreign. Bartholomew Sholto is found dead at the scene from poison that came from what Holmes and Watson note is not 'an English thorn' (Doyle 100), and next to him is the 'sign of four', an explicit marker of three foreign names. Yet in its conclusion, the mystery differs radically in its treatment of the foreign. While in Morgue, the sailor is ultimately culpable of at most negligence, in The Sign of Four, the primary antagonist is Jonathan Small, an Englishman. Unlike Morgue’s resolution that the murders were ultimately unmotivated acts of primal rage, The Sign of Four makes clear that the normal human motivation of greed, comprehensible to Europeans and quite surely present in European society, is responsible for this crime. Indeed, only someone from English society could have committed this crime, as its particulars involve more than the 'low cunning' of a savage, but rather required the 'delicate finesse' that Holmes concludes is usually a product of 'higher education' (Doyle 189). Yet perhaps there is room to reconcile these developments with the arguments of the Morgue. While the crime was broadly masterminded by an Englishman, the most savage part of the crime, the murder itself, was committed by a foreigner, a man with features that Watson notes as 'deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty' (Doyle 202). Indeed, when captured, Jonathan Small expresses that he 'grieved' at this unnecessary death. He himself rejects savagery of this nature, speaking quite calmly with his captors and explaining that he would have 'half killed Tonga' for this breach of the boundaries of normal society (Doyle 210). Perhaps Doyle is agreeing with Poe in the sense that, while some crime may come from Europeans, truly destructive and savage crime must have a foreign bent. </p><p>Yet this notion is quickly discarded by Doyle as he demonstrates that Small’s initial civilized appearance is an act. When confronted with his having discarded the treasure, Small 'drop[s] his mask of stoicism' and flies into a rage at the injustice of his situation. Watson now understands that, although Small was an Englishman, his 'fury' and 'passion' mean that Major Sholto was right to be terrified of Small, just as terrified as an Englishman would be of a foreign savage (Doyle 223). Indeed, as Small tells his story, we hear how he beats a prison guard to death. Though this murder is necessary for his escape, Small also takes pleasure in it, as the man had been cruel to him and Small had 'vowed vengeance' (Doyle 273). </p><p>Yet the argument of Doyle is not so simple as to declare all Englishmen as being equally capable of the terrifying violence of a savage. Small is not a normal Englishman. His wooden leg, one of the earliest clues in the mystery, marks him as being outside normal society, like a foreign savage. However, Small’s otherization is not the product of the natural order of things—it is the product of a random accident that could have befallen many an Englishmen. Doyle’s implication is discomforting—anyone, even the civilized, could fall victim to a situation that might draw them toward savage violence, an argument made viscerally by Doyle in the scene of the murder of the prison guard, as Small literally beats him to death with his wooden leg (Doyle 273).  Thus excluding a class of people from society cannot solve crime. This social argument is made more clear when Small impassionately defends his motivation for the crime. He argues that his oppression, his years in 'filthy convict huts', imprisoned and completing hard labor (Doyle 225), more than justify his claim to the treasure. This narrative of disenfranchisement as the root of crime also has implications for how we understand the role of the criminal foreigner. Small’s time in India makes clear that the Indians were subject to conditions similar to his, doing hard labor in fields under a strict overseer. If we are to be sympathetic to Small’s criminal motivations, we must also extend that understanding to the behavior of the foreign.</p><p>Detective fiction captivates not just because of how well a mystery lends itself to the art of suspense, but also because of our preexisting fascination with the nature of crime itself. Thus detective fiction can never be entirely fiction, since although a work may describe a crime that is fictional in nature, it is also describing the structure of a world in which such crime can happen, a description that will inevitably be translated by the reader into an explanation for why crime occurs in their own world. In this light, Doyle’s more complex narrative in The Sign of Four is a step forward from the similar tale of Morgue not only in its literary complexity, but in the more nuanced argument about the nature of crime that this work implicitly submits. By presenting a world where certainty is elusive and motivations are more grounded, Doyle suggests that crime might not be a foreign presence to be eradicated from the structure of society, but rather a natural consequence of society itself, a powerful argument for the further consideration of the potential social roots of crime that cautions against easy explanations that promise safety with any certainty.</p><button class=\"navitem bio\" onclick=\"goTo('projects')\">Return</button>";

Others achieve greatness by upending an existing system of thought, bringing about a paradigm shift and completely changing the foundation of a field in a way that becomes the basis for antecedent scholarship. It is in the latter category that we ought place Immanuel Kant with regard to his work on metaphysics as expressed in the Critique of Pure Reason.Through his analysis of the nature of metaphysical knowledge and the cognitive process, Kant developed an innovative new way of grounding our metaphysical knowledge claims that overcame the deficiencies of two primary traditions that preceded him. </p><p>To understand Kant’s revolution, one must understand the history of metaphysics up until his work.In the 18th century, two primary philosophical traditions held the most sway in metaphysical debates: empiricism and rationalism. The empiricists argued that all knowledge must be grounded in experiences of the natural world. Without experience as a starting point, there can be no cognition. At first blush, empiricism might allow one to establish certain metaphysical knowledge based on repeated experience. Basic metaphysical propositions like 'every effect has its cause' seem easy enough to establish given their seemingly obvious presence in every action and motion that we observe or encounter. The problem, however, is that knowledge established in this manner, through experience, can never be established as truly universal. Just because some maxim has been true of every object of experience that we have encountered thus far does not mean that it is impossible that we might later encounter or that there could otherwise exist some other object or set of objects that does not conform to this maxim. Experience tells us 'what is, but not that it must necessarily be so and not otherwise' (44).  The inability of experience to establish universal knowledge claims is problematic because of the nature of metaphysical claims. Metaphysical notions like causality, the immortal soul, and the nature of space and time are all explanations of foundational aspects of our existence and reality, of the nature of being itself. Metaphysics must therefore 'rise entirely above being instructed by experience' as it seeks to establish truths about the nature of experience itself. This contradiction between the nature of metaphysics and the limits of empirical knowledge claims means that for empiricists like Hume, it is seriously problematic to attempt to establish any metaphysical truth at all (xxix). </p><p>Rationalism proposes a potential solution to the disturbing skepticism of the empiricists. Instead of looking to knowledge that is a posteriori to or comes from experience, rationalism proposes the notion of a priori thought, or knowledge that we possess prior to every experience (45). Rationalists argue that some knowledge claims must necessarily be true in virtue of the definitions of the concepts the claim refers to. These claims, like 'all soccer players are athletes' must be true because within the predicate concept is contained the concept of the antecedent. Regardless of which specific object this claim is referencing, this claim must be true or there would be a contradiction. The law of non-contradiction, then, becomes the basis for all of these 'analytic' knowledge claims. The problem with this solution, as identified by Hume and later echoed by Kant, is that many supposedly analytic truths are, upon further inspection, synthetic (xxx). Whereas analytic knowledge claims relate two concepts, one of which is entirely contained within the other, synthetic claims relate two distinct concepts and are true not in virtue of the definitions of these concepts but rather because in reference to the world, the relationship identified by the synthetic claim holds true. As an example, the law of causality was held to be true analytically, but on closer inspection, it seems possible to conceive of an event happening by itself without a cause: I can imagine my pencil suddenly flying into the air, even if such a thing has not occurred before. Furthermore, the nature of analytic truths is that they are not contentful. They are true in virtue of the relationship between concepts, not in virtue of any sort of reference to an object and ensuing conceptual relationship. This is a problem because concepts have their boundaries defined by other concepts. To say all soccer players are athletes seems true, but if one were to demand an explanation of soccer player, one would receive an explanation containing the concept of soccer, of ball, of sport, and of player, and these concepts themselves would need further explanation. This is an infinitely regressive process, unless at some point in the chain there is a reference to an object. This is why Kant derides metaphysical exposition rooted solely in analytic truths as 'a groping about among mere concepts'. Metaphysical debates of this kind are a 'mock combat' insofar as they are not contentful debates about the nature of reality, as without reference to objects they are not truly descriptive (20). The metaphysical truths philosophers are interested in seem to clearly go beyond conceptual relations: the fact of God’s existence and other basic propositions like causality are propositions with contentful implications for our reality and seem to be claims about objects. Rationalist metaphysics up to this point is useless, insofar as it is either contentless because it is based solely on analytic truth, or dogmatic if it is based on a synthetic truth posing as an analytic truth taken to be true axiomatically. Thus emerges the central problem of metaphysics which Kant is seeking to address: metaphysical truths need to be universally and necessarily true while also being contentful and referring to objects. This seems to be impossible given the types of claims we have established—analytic claims are universally true a priori to any experience, but they lack content, while synthetic knowledge gained a posteriori from experience refers to objects and is contentful, but lacks universalizability.</p><p>Kant’s revolutionary solution to this problem is to decouple the notion of analyticity and syntheticity from the notion of a priori and a posteriori and suggest the existence of a type of truth previously thought to be impossible: the synthetic a priori. The problem of establishing synthetic truths as universal and necessary, preconditions for the a priori (46), was that if your statement is not merely formally true, it must be true in virtue of reference to objects, and thus could be false if applied to a different set of objects. Kant’s strategy, then, is to identify contentful claims that are true of the set of all objects, and not contingent on any particular object. In order to do so, Kant engages in a radical shift: instead of expanding cognition 'beyond all bounds of experience', Kant grounds his metaphysics in the nature of experience itself (9). Previously it had been assumed that our 'intuition had to conform to the character of its objects', but Kant suggests that conceiving of objects as conforming 'to the character of our power of intuition' (21). By arguing that all objects of experience must conform to the preconditions for sensibility, and by laying out what these preconditions are, Kant has a basis of contentful truth that applies to all objects and is not merely formal. In doing so, however, his approach makes some sacrifices. It eliminates the possibility of metaphysical knowledge (on the basis of pure reason) of objects that are not objects of experience, like 'God, freedom, and immortality' (31). Overall, his approach is a conservative one, seeking not to expand the bounds of our reason, but to critique it, and use the standard of synthetic a priori to determine which of our metaphysical knowledge claims are in fact valid rather than to expand outward toward new claims. While this approach may seem discouraging, limiting the bounds of our knowledge rather than expanding it, Kant argues that this innovation is actually a cause for hope (8). We can now be more confident in the limited metaphysical knowledge that we do have, opening up philosophy to actual investigation rather than mock combat. Like the restructuring of the natural sciences to conform to the scientific method, Kant’s restructuring of metaphysics as a science may seem to be primarily destructive rather than constructive initially, but in the end the elimination of pseudoscience is a precondition to a new age of discovery and inquiry.</p><button class=\"navitem bio\" onclick=\"goTo('projects')\">Return</button>";
